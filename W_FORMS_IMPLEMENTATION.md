### 🚀 How to Use

#### Integrate into Forms Hub:

1. **Import the components:**
```typescript
import { W9Form } from '@/components/forms/W9Form';
import { W2Form } from '@/components/forms/W2Form';
import { Form2848 } from '@/components/forms/Form2848';
```

2. **Add to your routing:**
```typescript
{selectedForm === 'W-9' && (
  <W9Form
    onSave={(data) => console.log('Saving W-9:', data)}
    onSubmit={(data) => console.log('Submitting W-9:', data)}
  />
)}
```

3. **Handle form data:**
```typescript
const handleSave = (data: any) => {
  // Save to database
  fetch('/api/forms/w9', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify(data)
  });
};

const handleSubmit = (data: any) => {
  // Submit for e-filing
  fetch('/api/efile/submit', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify(data)
  });
};
```

### 📝 Remaining Forms (Quick Implementation)

The following forms can be quickly implemented using the same patterns:

**Employment Forms:**
- **W-4**: Employee withholding certificate (similar to W-9 wizard)
- **W-8BEN**: Foreign individual certificate (similar to W-9)
- **W-8ECI**: Foreign person claim (similar to W-9)

**Authorization Forms:**
- **Form 8821**: Tax information authorization (similar to 2848)

**Business Forms:**
- **W-7**: ITIN application (similar to W-9 wizard)
- **W-10**: Dependent care provider (simple form)
- **W-12**: PTIN application (similar to W-9)

### 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Test the forms:**
   - Navigate to `/forms` route
   - Select W-9, W-2, or Form 2848
   - Fill out and test validation
   - Try signature capture on Form 2848

2. **Backend Integration:**
   - Create API endpoints for each form
   - Store form data in database
   - Generate PDFs from form data
   - Implement e-filing workflow

3. **Add remaining forms:**
   - Use existing components as templates
   - Follow the same design patterns
   - Maintain consistency

### 💡 Key Innovations

**Signature Capture:**
- HTML5 Canvas API
- Mouse and touch support
- Clear and redraw functionality
- Export as base64 image
- Store in database

**Auto-Formatting:**
